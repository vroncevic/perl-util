Utilities (Perl scripts)

The README is used to introduce the modules and provide instructions on
how to install the modules, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the modules are installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
